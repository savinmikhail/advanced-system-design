По мере приближения к максимальной пропускной способности средний размер очереди (и, следовательно, среднее время ожидания) стремится к бесконечности.

The First Law of Software Architecture, as stated by Mark Richards, is:

“Everything in software architecture is a trade-off.”

No design choice is universally "good" or "bad"; each has consequences that must be evaluated in the context of the system's goals, constraints, and long-term maintainability.

Business priorities evolve, and trade-offs may shift over time.
A software system needs to fulfill multiple competing requirements: performance, scalability, maintainability, security, cost, and complexity. Achieving one often comes at the expense of another.

1. Performance vs. Scalability
2. Maintainability vs. Performance
3. Simplicity vs. Flexibility
4. Security vs. Usability
5. Cost vs. Reliability
6. Cost vs. Flexibility
7. Time-to-Market vs. Technical Debt
8. Consistency vs. Availability (CAP Theorem)
